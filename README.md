# LITE-mpc

This document is a guide to participating in Multi-party Computation(MPC) phase 2 and verifying the result.

## What should I do ? 

1. Send an email to tronz_tech@tron.network to apply to participate in MPC. Please introduce yourself in the email and tell us your available time.

2. TRON will send you an email about the time for you to participate in MPC.

3. When it is your turn, TRON will send you a notification email and give you a params file link which you will need to download.

4. Download the `params` file on server. Minimum requirements of server requires:
  + Processor (CPU): Intel Core i5 (sixth generation or newer) or equivalent
  + Operating System: Linux (Recommended) / macOS / Windows 7+         
  + Memory: 8 GB RAM
  + Storage: 500 GB internal storage drive

 
5. Download and install IM tool [keybase](https://keybase.io/). If you don't have an account yet, create an account and add TRON' account as your friends. TRON's account is `tron_brown`.

6. Run the following code in your terminal to download Rustup and install Rust, then follow the instructions if you are running on macOS / Linux / another Unix-like OS:
```
# curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

&emsp;&emsp;If you are running on windows, please go to [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) homepage for installation instruction. In linux, you may need to run as prompted after installation:
```
# source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

7. Obtain the source code of project tron-mpc-testnet:
```
# git clone https://github.com/tronprotocol/tron-mpc-testnet
```
&emsp;&emsp;If git has not been installed on your computer, please refer to [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) first.

8. Put `params` file in the tron-mpc-testnet directory, then run:
```
# cargo run --release --bin compute
```
&emsp;&emsp;When itâ€™s finished, you will get a `new_params` file and a `hash` which you will need to memorize. You can find the `hash` and `new_params` as shown below:
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tronprotocol/documentation-en/master/docs_without_index/internal-test/sapling-output.jpg)

&emsp;&emsp;Notice: this process could take 0.5 ~ 1 hours according to your hardware capacity and occupy 1.5 ~ 2GB of memory.

9. Send your result to TRON. Send the file `new_params` by keybase and `hash` by email. Feel free to state your os version in email. E.g. windows 7/centos 7.

## Dependency
We reuse the phase 2 result of zcash https://download.z.cash/sapling-mpc/params as the first `params` of the process. At the end of process, we generate the random beacon by using one Bitcoin block's hash as the seed of pseudo random number generator; The block's height will not be determined until last participant completes his operation. After we verify all participants' contribution, we will publish all hash on project [wiki](https://github.com/tronprotocol/tron-mpc-testnet/wiki) page. Anyone can do this verification as belows.

## How to verify my contribution ?

After all participants finish the process, we will announce final params at aws. Following as below to verify your contribution:
```
# cd tron-mpc-testnet
# wget https://mpcfilepub.s3.amazonaws.com/tron-mpc-testnet/params
# wget https://mpcfilepub.s3.amazonaws.com/powersoftau/powersoftau_phase1_files.tar
# tar xvf powersoftau_phase1_files.tar && cp powersoftau_phase1_files/* .
# cargo run --release --features="verification" --bin verify
```
This verification may take about 1 hour and then output all participants' contribution. Find whether your hash is in the list.
